# Python-Challenge
Module 3 Assignment for Data BootCamp

PART 1: Financial Analysis with Python
>This Python script analyzes the financial records of a company using data from a CSV file and outputs the results to a text file.

Requirements
>Python 3.x

Usage
>Download the budget_data.csv file to the 'Resources' Folder in the same directory as the Python script.
Additionally, create a 'Output' Folder in the same directory as the Python script.

Running the script
>To run the script, navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved and enter the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

python main.py

>The script will print the analysis results to the console and save them to a text file named output.txt in a folder named output.

Output
>The script outputs the following analysis results to the console and the text file:

>Total number of months included in the dataset
>Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
>Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
>Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
>Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PART 2: Election Results with Python
>This script analyzes the results of a local election and calculates the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. The results are printed to the console and saved to a text file.

Requirements
>To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. 

Usage
>You'll need to download the election_data.csv file and save it to a folder called Resources in the same directory as the Python script.
Additionally, create a 'Output' Folder in the same directory as the Python script.

Running the Script
>To run the script, navigate to the directory where the Python script is saved and enter the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

python main.py

>The script will then execute and output the results to the console and a text file called election_results.txt.

Output:
>The script will output the following results:

>The total number of votes cast
>A complete list of candidates who received votes
>The percentage of votes each candidate won
>The total number of votes each candidate won
>The winner of the election based on popular vote
>The results will be printed to the console in the following format:

>The results will also be saved to a text file called election_results.txt in the 'Output' Folder which is in the same directory as the Python script.
